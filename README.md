# Deep Audio Classifier Project

This project is for classifying audio files using deep learning techniques. The project involves preprocessing audio data, training a model, and evaluating its performance.

## Requirements:

- Python 3.x

- numpy

- pandas

- tensorflow

- librosa

- matplotlib

## Project Overview:

The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately classify audio files into predefined categories. This involves several steps:

#### Algorithm Description

- Dataset: The dataset includes various audio clips labeled as Capuchin bird calls, non-Capuchin bird calls, and other forest sounds. The data come from a well-defined source Kaggle competition dataset.

- Steps:

1. Convert audio data to waveforms: Audio data is read and converted into a format (waveform) that can be processed.

2. Transform waveforms into spectrograms: Spectrograms provide a visual representation of the audio signal's frequency spectrum over time.

3. Classify Capuchin bird calls using the transformed data: A CNN model processes the spectrograms to classify the audio clips.

#### Data Preparation

- Dependencies: Installation of libraries such as TensorFlow, TensorFlow I/O (for audio processing), and Matplotlib for plotting.
- Downloading Dataset: The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle using the Kaggle API.
- File Handling: Instructions for copying Kaggle API credentials and setting directory permissions to access the dataset.

#### Training and Evaluation: 

Train the model on the dataset and evaluate its performance.

#### Inference: 

Use the trained model to classify new audio samples.

## Dataset:

The dataset used in this project consists of audio files categorized into different classes. This dataset can be downloaded from Dataset Source. Ensure that the dataset is organized into folders for each class.

## Usage:

#### 1. Clone the Repository

code:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AudioClassifier.git

cd AudioClassifier

#### 2. Prepare the Data

Download the dataset and place it in the data/ directory. Ensure the data is organized into subfolders for each class.

#### 3. Run the Notebook

Open the Jupyter notebook located in the notebooks/ directory and run the cells sequentially to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Key Sections in the Notebook

#### Data Loading and Preprocessing:

- Load audio files using librosa.

- Normalize and prepare the data for model training.

#### Model Building:

Define a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for audio classification using TensorFlow.

#### Training:

Train the model using the preprocessed data.

code:

history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=30, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

#### Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset.

Visualize the results using confusion matrices and accuracy/loss plots.

## Results:

After training the model, you can evaluate its performance using various metrics and visualize the results. The notebook provides detailed visualizations and performance metrics to help understand the model's accuracy and potential improvements.
